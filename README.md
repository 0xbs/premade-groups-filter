# Premade Groups Filter

Premade Groups Filter helps you limit the search results of the LFG Premade Groups tool. You can filter by difficulty or for groups with a specific composition of members, e.g. one tank, no heals and 3 dps. Filtering is done using a separate window next to the list of groups. Advanced users are able to enter powerful filter expressions to find exactly what they are looking for.

* mythic dungeon groups that still need a healer
* raids that have not yet defeated any bosses and already have more than 10 members and an item level requirement of 850
* PvP groups with an honor level requirement and voice chat
